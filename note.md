## How to use AI in daily workflow

1. System Command Helper
    Use AI (GPT/copilot) to generate system commands to meet my need. for example generate the commands to filter a list files by properties(size, or name patterns).
2. **Code Generation**: 
    Use copilot to generate code snippets for certain functions like: API arguments, basical class/function definitions, documentation, etc.
3. **Documentation**:
    Use AI to refine the words for documentation, like README.md, papers.
4. **Code Review**:
    Use AI to review the code, find bugs, and suggest improvements.
5. **Learning**:
    Use AI to learn new concepts, like new frameworks.
6. **Writing**:
    Leverage AI to write some notes and documentation with better words.
    Note: This document is co-written with Copilot, with a lot help to fix typos, markdown formatting issues.
